              <h2><strong>HISTORY</strong></h2>

              <p>
                      Pizza history is very interesting. The actual word “pizza” was first documented in 997 AD in Gaeta, Italy, and successively in different parts of Central and South Italy.  While pizza has been eaten in Italy for centuries, it was not until after World War II and when pizza became popular in America, that it became really popular in Italy.
                        <br>
              Pizza is a baked pie of Italian origin consisting of a shallow bread-like crust covered with seasoned tomato sauce, cheese, and often other toppings such as sausage or olive.  The word pizza is believed to be from an Old Italian word meaning “a point,” which in turn became the Italian word “pizzicare,” which means “to pinch” or “pluck.”
                        <br>
              In one of its many forms, pizza has been a basic part of the Italian diet since the Stone Age.  This earliest form of pizza was a crude bread that was baked beneath the stones of the fire.  After cooking, it was seasoned with a variety of different toppings and used instead of plates and utensils to sop up broth or gravies.  It is said that the idea of using bread as a plate came from the Greeks who ate flat round bread (plankuntos) baked with an assortment of toppings . It was eaten by the working man and his family because it was a thrifty and convenient food.
                        <br>
              The pizza actually could have been invented by the Phoenicians, the Greeks, Romans, or anyone who learned the secret of mixing flour with water and heating it on a hot stone.
